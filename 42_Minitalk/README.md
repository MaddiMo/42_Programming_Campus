# Minitalk

## Introduction

In this project, I had to create a programme where, through UNIX binary signal transmission a message is sent from a Client to a Server.

### Mandatory

   - Create *server* & *client* executables
   - Only allowed the use of *SIGURS1* & *SIGURS2* signals

### Allowed functions ... I used

 - write
 - free
 - getpid
 - signal
 - pause
 - kill
 - usleep
