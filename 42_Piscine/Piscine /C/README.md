# 42 Piscine

The Piscine is a 4-week-long trial period during which I discovered coding (C programming language) from scratch. This was extremely intensive and required commitment. I was programming around 9-10 hours a day with no day-breaks, not even on the weekends. Nevertheless, one of the most rewarding and difficult 4-weeks of my life learning C.

All is self-taught and uses a peer-to-peer approach. I applied my time-management skills, as well as learned to work under a lot of pressure in a fast-paced environment, as it is a very intense 4-weeks that required to learn skills rapidly in a very short time, where problem-solving and adaptability where key.

The Piscine consists of maintaining focus and motivation on programming. I worked with many people who had previous experience and knowledge of programming in C or other languages. Due to this fact, I developed my capabilities to manage frustration as many of my folks where much more advanced than me. However, I proudly improved greatly my programming skills, learned to keep going and patience, so important in this field, and empathised a love for programming and C.
